## What I learned

The main thing I learned here is how to use the `mix-bland-mode` property to add that purple color over the image. I have put the background-color on the picture element, and used this declaration on the img element:

```
mix-blend-mode: multiply;
opacity: 0.75;
```

Also, I used the picture element to change the image source for the mobile view.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
